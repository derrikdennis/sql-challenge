#Week 09 - SQL-Challenge

This week's assignment four distinct components. This document will identify each of those components and what they entailed.


## - Section 1 - Data Mining

In this section, I used freeware at quickdatabasedesigns.com in order to create an ERD regarding the SQL database.  I assigned primary keys, along with foreigns keys relating back to employees.emp_no and departments.dept_no.  The ERD can be found with the file Data_Modeling_ERD.png

## - Section 2 - Data Engineering

For this section, I cereated the file DataEngineering.sql which can be found in the EmployeeSQL file folder.  This file will drop SQL datatables, if necessary, and then create the six tables needed for the rest of the assignment.  The user will have to provide those six tables or request it from the owner of this repository.  Use PGAdmin4 in order to finish importing the files.

## - Section 3 Data Analysis.

All eight analysis have been carefully coded into the DataAnalysis.sqlfile. Each analysis also creates a view which can be seen in the SQL-Database.

## - Section 4.0 Bpm

Finally I take a deeper dive in the data, transferring SQL tables over into distinct dataframes  focused on the salaries class. Two charts are made: a histogram of salaries grouped in bands of $5K, an a look at average salaries by job title.  Fjnally,  APril Fools to you too.  In July.
